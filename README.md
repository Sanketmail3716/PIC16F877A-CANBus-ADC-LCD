# PIC16F877A-CANBus-ADC-LCD
This project demonstrates communication between three PIC16F877A microcontroller nodes over the MCP2515 CAN bus. Each node reads analog data via ADC, sends or receives it using CAN, and displays the values on an LCD. Ideal for learning CAN protocol, ADC interfacing, and real-time embedded networking.
